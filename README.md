The Bolt Programming Language
=============================

This repository contains a prototype of the Bolt programming language, written
in [Haskell][1]. Thanks to the power of Haskell, we are able to make very quick
changes to the language without having to refactor the entire compiler. If
everything goes well, we might be able to bootstrap the Bolt compiler this way.
